# Chemicals-in-Cosmetics-Analysis (SKILLPHORE databulos group) :chart_with_downwards_trend:
As one of the final tasks at the end of the Data Analytics Contest organized by one of the Data communities I joined **(Skillphore)**, my group **(Databulos)** were required to
scrutinize a **Chemicals in cosmetics dataset**, explore information on the chemicals used in cosmetics and personal care products and share insights on an interactive dashboard
using **Tableau**.

## Data Overview :scroll:
The dataset provided contains information on chemicals, including the name of the chemical, the company that uses it, the category of cosmetic it is used in, 
and the date it was first reported.

The data dictionary provides more information on what each column represents.

It can be downloaded on [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com)

## Methodology üìñ
As a team with constant communication and feedback amongst ourselves:
 
 (1) We utilised the data dictionary to better understand what each column represents.
 
 (2) As a result of the data being dirty, with wrongly spelt texts, typographical errors and wrong formatting, we had to clean the data by using SQL Functions for manipulating data such as the UPDATE,SET, REPLACE, ALTER TABLE, ALTER COLUMN and CAST functions.
 
 (3) After cleaning the data, we proceeded to analysis but first agreed on the questions to be answered to gain insights about the dataset.
 
 (4) We ran SQL queries to query the database and got the answers we desired.
 
 (5) To ease understanding for our stakeholders,  we created a dashboard using Tableau.
                            
## The Tableau Steps Utilized üé®:
(1) Imported the data as a CSV file into tableau.

(2) Created separate worksheets to answer separate questions.

(3) Created our visualization on each worksheet.

(4) We created our dashboard individually and chose one dashboard and we tweaked it together to attain the desired result. 

(5) Finally, we agreed on a theme colour; blue which is one of the colour codes of chemicals.
